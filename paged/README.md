Nextjs like framework built on top of bundless, esbuild and react router

##Â IDEAS

-   function in the rpc folder are normal functions when called in the server and trigger a fetch request when called in the client
-   add a docker command that builds a docker image, this is useful because otherwise the server would need to build using esbuild on start to get the static outputs, this also let me bundle the server in a single files without dependencies, which makes the docker image build lighter and faster to build
