-   test the html entries resolution (public, name.html, html paths in entries, ...)
-   prebundleWorkspacePackages option (can be glob[], glob or boolean)
-   profile the plugins, maybe the wrapper can wrap the plugins onLoad and onResolve functions to make this work both on server and build, or just wrap the plugins executor methods?
-   implement postcss processing to enable sass, tailwind, ...
-   implement build.basePath changing esbuild publicPath and other plugins like paged that inject virtual files at root
