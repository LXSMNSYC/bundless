-   use data url for loading svgs
-   make a config for assetExtensions, to let user import any file and return its path
-   includeWorkspacePackages prebundles html files
-   put the onResolve function in the plugins executor, this way it does not depend on the presence of node-resolve plugin
-   replace node-resolve in the traversal with bare imports plugin
-   ~~add a way to order plugins after or before the builtin plugins~~
-   do not rely on the node resolve package for anything, add an additional plugin and add node-resolve only when in yarn pnp
-   replace external but in meta with a dummy plugin that registers imports
-   add support for multiple errors in error panel
-   ~~do not run esbuild transform if loader is already js~~
-   ~~run all user plugins first, make react refresh use the js loader as output~~
-   check that inline sourcemaps are used by esbuild transformer
-   instead of using source-map-support for the error panel use source-map package directly, this way there is not need for sync xhr
-   only use sourcemaps on user packages, npm packages seem to not publish src directory
-   ~~dynamic imports should not reorder exports, depend on esbuild~~
-   when there is an error and using HMR, do not refresh, instead try to run react refresh and see if it works
-   investigate dynamic imports with ssr interoperability, now dynamic imports are fetched only on client
-   add warning for multiple node modules paths for same package when this package is peer of something
-   watch ignore should be more strict, no regex
-   remove require warnings from paged (only use require when platform is node)
-   investigate if using new extensions in a plugins require you to add a resolver, maybe add a universal resolver that resolves all extensions (if they are present in the import path)
-   think about core feature for bundless for promotion in twitter (esbuild plugins, benchmarks, ssr, meta framework, build speed, monorepo support, hmr fixes, multiple entrypoints,)
-   how to make project sustainable? offer migration support for react-scripts and stuff like that?
-   make tests for esbuild plugins interoperability, tests fixture contain the plugins in the config
-   makes bundless internal stuff paths start with .bundless, makes easier to analyze network requests
-   ~~put everything inside .bundless, make this directory path configurable, this way tools like vitro can use .vitro~~
-   use basePath to change the index.html page relative urls, this way there is no need to %PUBLIC_URL% need, / -> /base-path/
-   more tests for hmr, using puppeteer
-   test basepath feature
-   test sourcemaps are correct, throwing errors and checking the browser error line
-   test the html entries resolution (public, name.html, html paths in entries, ...)
-   implement postcss processing to enable sass, tailwind, ...
