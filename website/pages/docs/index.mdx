## Getting Started

Bundless is an application development server and bundler

It is a replacement for tools like webpack and parcel

The difference with those tools is mainly speed, bundless has a much faster dev server load time and build time, see the [benchmarks](/benchmarks) to read more

```sh
npm i -g @bundless/cli
bundless quickstart ./my-app # will guide you on creating an example project
```
