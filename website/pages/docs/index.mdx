## Getting Started

Bundless is an experimental application development server and bundler.

It is a replacement for tools like webpack and parcel, with the main aim being development and build speed with as less as possible compromises.

To try out an example application run the following commands to setup an example application

```sh
npm i -g @bundless/cli
bundless quickstart ./my-app # will download an example app inside my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## How is bundless faster than my favorite build tool?

Bundless is different than traditional bundlers, it doesn't build your files to one large bundle, it instead serve your files directly to the browser

This means that bundless doesn't need to parse your files, which is the most costly operation done by tools like webpack

This means that when you make a change to a file only the changed module is fetched, this makes the hmr implementation much simpler compared to tools like webpack that need instead runtime logic to handle code replacement.
