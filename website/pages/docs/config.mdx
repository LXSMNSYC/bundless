# Config

The default bundless configuration is the following

```js
/** @type { import('@bundless/cli').Config } */
module.exports = {
    entries: ['index.html'], // entry files
    platform: 'browser', // target platform, browser or node
    jsx: 'react', // jsx preset
    importableAssetsExtensions: ['.3ds'], // extension that return their path when imported
    plugins: [],
    server: {
        port: 3000,
        hmr: true,
        openBrowser: false, // opens browser on server start
    },
    prebundle: {
        includeWorkspacePackages: [], // linked packages to prebundle, can be a boolean
        force: false, // forces prebundling dependencies on server start
    },
    build: {
        basePath: '/',
        jsTarget: 'es2018', // target es version
        minify: true, // run esbuild minification
        outDir: './out', // output directory
    },
}
```

## entries

In the prebundle phase entries are used as starting point to traverse the import graph and gather dependencies.

In the build phase they are passes to esbuild to be bundled and outputted in outDir.

## platform

Can be `browser` or `node`.

When platform is `node` the output files will use commonjs modules and won't bundle dependencies (files in node_modules are marked as external).

## prebundle.includeWorkspacePackages

By default bundless does not prebundle your workspace packages, this means that you can import files from your monorepo dependencies and have them reflect changes thanks to HMR.

However this won't work if your liked dependencies contains commonjs code that uses `require` and `module.exports`, in this case you should put these packages in `prebundle.includeWorkspacePackages` or use `prebundle.includeWorkspacePackages: true`

## build.basePath

If you are deploying your website to an url like `http://mysite.com/path`, then you should pass `/path` to `build.basePath`, all the `script` and `link` tags in the html files will fetch files from base path, the same for dynamic imports.

## includeWorkspacePackages

Extensions you import in your js and return their path
