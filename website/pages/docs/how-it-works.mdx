# How does bundless work?

Bundless works differently when in development and in build, to share as much logic as possible bundless encapsulates as much logic as possible in plugins.

The bundless Plugin interface is a superset of [esbuild's plugin interface](https://esbuild.github.io/plugins/), this means that the same plugins can be used both when running in development and in build phase.

Esbuild is not only used in the build phase, it is also used to traverse the module graph in the `prebundle` phase and to bundle dependencies.

The prebundle phase consists in

-   traverse the module import graph
-   gather all imports to files in node_modules
-   bundle these files in valid ES modules
-   store them in the `web_modules` directory

The prebundle phase is necessary to make commonjs code work in the browser and reduce the number of network requests to fetch modules.

In development bundless is a web server that serves your modules to the browser.

It also has does some built in transformations to your files

-   import paths are rewritten to path on root, `import './file'` becomes `import '/path/to/file.js'`

-   import paths are resolved to their path
s
-   plugins `onLoad` and `onTransform` methods are called on the module contents

When building the entries are passed to `esbuild` to be bundles

Html files are converted to js files that import their scripts src urls (only those that are inside your root directory)
