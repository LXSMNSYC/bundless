# How does bundless work?

Bundless works differently in development and build

In development bundless is a web server that serves your modules to the browser.

It also has does some built in transformations to your files

-   import paths are rewritten to path on root, `import './file'` becomes `import '/path/to/file.js'`

-   import paths are resolved to their path
s
-   plugins `onLoad` and `onTransform` methods are called on the module contents

When building the entries are passed to `esbuild` to be bundles

Html files are converted to js files that import their scripts src urls (only those that are inside your root directory)
